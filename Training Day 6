Today is the Day 6 of my training, I continued exploring the advanced concepts of HTML and CSS, focusing on creating interactive forms, transitions, and animations. 
I learned how to build user-friendly forms using various HTML elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons.
After forms, I moved on to CSS transitions, which allowed me to add smooth effects like color changes, resizing, and hover effects etc.
After that I have done a task of creating a  sign in form . With this my day was ended.
