Today was the 8th day of my web development training, and I worked on creating a structured and visually appealing project using HTML and CSS. In this project, I designed and implemented several key sections of a website, starting with the navigation bar. The navbar includes a logo and menu links, making it easy for users to navigate between different parts of the website. I used Flexbox to align the items properly and added hover effects for a more interactive feel. After that, I created the domain block, which allows users to search for domain availability. This section includes a text input field and a styled button, designed to catch attention and encourage user interaction.with this my day was ended.
