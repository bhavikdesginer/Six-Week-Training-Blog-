Training Day 2

Today marked the second day of my training, and I continued working on replicating the recipe page. The desktop version is complete, and now I'm focusing on making it mobile-responsive. To begin, I conducted some research to understand how to implement responsiveness.

Through my research, I learned about media queries and how they can be used to adjust the layout based on the device's screen size. I watched several tutorials on YouTube and used AI tools to deepen my understanding. After grasping the concept, I practiced implementing media queries on basic tasks.

Following that, I resumed working on the task assigned by my mentor. While I made progress, I wasn't able to fully complete the mobile responsiveness just yet. I discussed the issue with my mentor, who kindly provided me with a detailed video tutorial on how to implement responsiveness more effectively.

Today, I learned a lot about media queries and the importance of mobile responsiveness. It was a valuable experience and Iâ€™m excited to continue improving.
