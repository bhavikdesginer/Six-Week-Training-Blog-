Today is the fifth day of my  training, I Progressed deeper into the advanced concepts of HTML and CSS, doing Part 2 of the module and progressing up to Module 4, i.e.-images. The session began with a quick recap of semantic HTML elements such as <section>, <article>  then I did advance concepts of CSS including the box model, positioning techniques like relative, absolute, and fixed,  Flexbox. After that <img> tag, setting attributes like alt, width, and height, and styling them with CSS  
Overall, Day 5 was both informative and practical.
