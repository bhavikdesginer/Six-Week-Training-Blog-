Training Day-3

Today, I focused on learning about responsiveness in HTML and CSS. I studied how to design websites that adapt to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones. I watched 2.5 hours of video tutorials and tried to implement what I learned into my code. Although some parts were still confusing, I made a strong effort to understand the concepts.

I made changes to my webpage based on what I learned. Some elements are now responsive and displaying correctly, while others still need adjustments. I also developed a better understanding of media queries and how they allow me to apply specific styles depending on the screen width. I experimented with using both fluid and fixed widths to make my design more flexible.

It was a hectic day, but I did my best to push through and make progress. Iâ€™ve sent you the update to my mentor to be informed, and with that, my day comes to an end.
