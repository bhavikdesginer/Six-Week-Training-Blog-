Training Day 1

Today was the first day of my training. I was very excited for the new beginning.
My day started with the introduction with my mentor. I introduced my self and talk about my previous projects.
My mentor gave me the first task then to replicate food recipe web page with html and css.
I created firstly the basic blue print of the web page given with html elements and after that to beautify it,used css.
Overall page is done, responsiveness is left. I enjoyed a lot working on my first training task.
