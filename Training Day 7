Today is my 7 th day of training as you know I have done basic and advance HTML and CSS so, Now it's time for creating a project 

In this project, I focused on designing and developing a modern, responsive website using only HTML and CSS. The aim was to build a user-friendly interface and we  while following a consistent color pattern across the site. The design process started with proper planning of layout and structure, ensuring the site adapts well to all screen sizes using responsive techniques like media queries and flexible layouts.

Today I leaned about typography, functional links, badges, structured lists, icons, and buttons..

Typography played role in improving readability and aesthetics. Such as different font families, sizes, and weights.Links were styled with hover effects and make it accessible. For lists, both ordered and unordered formats were used to organize content and different icons were added.


Overall, this project demonstrates how  HTML and CSS can be used to create a clean, responsive, and attractive website without the need of  complex frameworks. With this my day was ended.
